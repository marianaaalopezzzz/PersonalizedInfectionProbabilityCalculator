# PersonalizedInfectionProbabilityCalculator

Our primary goal is for the user to input their specific factors such as age, disease type, environmental conditions, etc to receive a risk estimation for the infection. 
This will help users to understand how personal and eviromental factors can affect their probalities for transmissible diseases. 

The main five object that we will usea to calculate de infection risk. 
1. User. (the person using the calculator)
   The attributes will be:
   a) age
   b) gender
   c) an pre-existing health condition
   d) vaccines
2. Disease. (Characterisitcs of the disease)
   The atribbutes will be:
   a) name
   b) probality of transmission
   c) disease's severity
   d) Transmission Method
3. RiskFactor. (externsl and eviromental factors that will affect)
   The attributes will be:
   a) climate such as humid, dry, or cold
   b) number of peoble in the area
   c) hygene level
4. RiskCalculator. (final risk calculation (user, disease, and riskfactor))
   The atrÂ¡tribute will be:
   a) the initial base risk
5. Report. (Displays the information clarly for the user)
   The attributes will be:
   a) final calculated probability
   b) summary of results with some recommendations.
